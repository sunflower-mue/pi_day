This is a personal prject to celebrate pi day 14 March 2023.

Phase 1: 

Topics covered in the code include:
*Mathematics Spiral Equation.
*Scatter plot.
*Color Map.
*matplotlib pyplot.
*chudnovsky algorithm to compute pi digits.
*numpy arrays.
*Choice of Python Documentation (PEP-257).

chudnovskypi.py includes the algorithm to produce pi digits up to 999 digits
after the decimal point which are stored in a .txt by redirecting the output.

pidigs.py stores the 999 pi digits after the decimal in a numpy array as type
int.

scatter.py uses python color map to draw a spiral with each dot representing the
pi digits from the center outward in an anti-clockwise direction.

TODO:

*Neat Documentation.
*Prompt user input instead of fixed input.
*credit to helpful online reference .
*better graphics.

Loadshedding robbed me off of three days of coding so this is the first
commit(Version one)
